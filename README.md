# ToDo App (Mobile)

## Description

This is a basic To-Do List app built with React Native, designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. The app allows users to:

- Add new tasks: Enter task descriptions and save them to the list.
- Search for tasks: Quickly find tasks by typing in the search bar.
- Mark tasks as complete: Tap on tasks to toggle their completion status (checked/un-checked).
